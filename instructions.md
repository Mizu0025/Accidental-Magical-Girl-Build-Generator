# Goal
SPA application for generating a character build for the CYOA 'Accidental Magical Girl'.

# Requirements
- User-friendly interface
- Ability to customize character attributes
- Integration with CYOA game mechanics
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

# Technologies
- React.js
- Redux
- Jest

# Development Plan
- Define project structure and architecture
- Implement user interface components
- Create Redux store and actions
- Write unit tests using Jest
- Implement CYOA game mechanics
- Integrate with data.js and coin-spend.txt
- Test and debug application
- Deploy to production

# CYOA Info
- build is generated by rolling 11d20 and assigning the result of each roll to the character's choices
- data for choices is in data.js
- coin spend logic is in coin-spend.txt

# Current Progress
## Development Plan
- Define project structure and architecture
- Implement user interface components
- Create Redux store and actions
- Write unit tests using Jest
- Implement CYOA game mechanics
- Integrate with data.js and coin-spend.txt
- Test and debug application
- Deploy to production

## Current Status
- Initial React project setup using `create-react-app`.
- Redux and React-Redux installed.
- Architecture planning and directory structure definition are ongoing.

## Next Steps
1. **Define Project Structure and Architecture**
   - Finalize the directory structure.
   - Define component hierarchy.
2. **Implement User Interface Components**
   - Create basic components for character customization.
   - Implement responsive design using CSS or a library like Bootstrap.
3. **Create Redux Store and Actions**
   - Set up the Redux store.
   - Define actions for character attribute changes.
4. **Write Unit Tests Using Jest**
   - Write tests for components.
   - Write tests for Redux actions and reducers.
5. **Implement CYOA Game Mechanics**
   - Implement the logic for rolling 11d20.
   - Assign roll results to character choices based on data in `data.js`.
6. **Integrate with data.js and coin-spend.txt**
   - Load and parse data from `data.js`.
   - Implement coin spend logic as defined in `coin-spend.txt`.
7. **Test and Debug Application**
   - Conduct thorough testing.
   - Debug any issues found during testing.
8. **Deploy to Production**
   - Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
   - Deploy the application.

# Additional Notes
- Ensure that all components are well-documented.
- Keep the codebase clean and maintainable.
- Regularly commit changes with descriptive messages.
