# Accidental Magical Girl CYOA

Allows generation of character builds for the 'Accidental Magical Girl' choose-your-own-adventure document, via a HTML + Typescript SPA.

# Character Build

To create a character, you simply load the html page, after which all options are generated randomly via 11 1d20 dice rolls. These choices can also be altered via currency given to the user, although the exact amount differs based off your origin (not-yet-implemented).

Character build options are:

- Age (roll 1)
- Body (roll 2)
- Specialisation (roll 3)
- Weapon (roll 4)
- Outfit (roll 5)
- Power (roll 6)
- Perks (dice roll 7 through 11)

# Currency

You gain 1 gold, 3 silver and 4 bronze coins by default, although your origin can increase or decrease this sum.
