## 👗 Roll 5: OUTFIT (File 9)
* Requires a phrase or incantation (15 uninterrupted seconds of sparkling transformation).
* Provides basic **physical protection** similar to full plate armor (regardless of appearance) and will keep anyone from connecting your identity.
* **Untransformed:** Statline is reduced to **3** across the board.
* Stat boosts marked with a **†** apply when out of costume.
* **Bronze:** +/- 4 from your roll.
* **Silver:** Pick your outfit.

| **6-10** | **Flowing** | Coats, robes, capes, togas, hakama, etc. | +1 STR |

## 💥 Roll 6: POWER (Files 10, 11)
* A special skill you can perform with magic.
* **Bronze:** +/- 2 from your roll.
* **Silver:** Swap to any power.
* **Gold:** Select a **SECOND** power.

| Roll Range | Power | Description | Notes |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **1-2** | **Killing Blow** | An overwhelming attack that dumps all of your mana into a single blow. Guaranteed kill on most strong monsters if it hits. | **+1 STR or MAG** (Choose type: Physical or Magical). If missed, you are depleted, exhausted, and vulnerable. |
| **3-4** | **Hammerspace** | Instant access to an extra-dimensional storage space of infinite capacity. | Stores non-living material, food, and other time-sensitive items in stasis. Items retrieve easily and quickly into your hands. Cannot store anything you can physically lift. |
| **5-6** | **Twinned Soul** | Transformation splits your soul and shard into its own body & mind (same age, development, specialization, and base power roll). | You love and won't betray each other. You share stats/perks (but only 1 actual artifact/big friend/etc.). You can alert them when needed, and they instinctively know where you are. Gold/Silver spent on **stats** affects both. Silver spent on **perks** splits the bonus, and spells that affect one can affect the other simultaneously. You take a **-1 in all stats**. |
| **7-8** | **Focused Assault** | You focus on a target, allowing you to put far more mana into an attack than normal. | Puts very punishing or penetrating blows on a single enemy. Takes time to focus and concentrate. Not as potent as Killing Blow, but can be repeated until you run out of juice. Can choose the form of the attack (melee or ranged). |
| **9-10** | **Barrage** | You can put out a lot of fire (attacks). Extremely efficient at casting small attacks in rapid succession. | Can destroy hordes of weak enemies with ease. Can add secondary explosive effects to larger spells, allowing them to have a radius that catches minions in the blast. |
| **11-12** | **Power of Friendship** | You have an instinctive sense of when people are sad, how to cheer them up, and how to get in their good graces. | People tend to think the best of you, give you multiple second chances, and will generally try to help you. Can be allies and contacts easily with a bit of extended conversation. Can sometimes manage to make an action even bring some monsters to respect you or cease preying on humans. Works even out of costume. |
| **13-14** | **Duplication** | You can split off duplicates of yourself with a moment of concentration. Costs mana, but maintaining them costs little. | They are not very magical, but their bodies are just as solid as yours, and they can hit just as hard. Attack strength is enough to harm you to destroy the duplicates. They don't automatically relay their experiences, but can merge with you to relay a small portion of their experience (may be disorienting). |
| **15-16** | **Third Eye** | You have the Sight, allowing you to see the flows and after effects of magic. Your sense of magic is extremely precise. | You can pierce illusions, trace the effects of faded rituals, or know the type of magic being used at a glance. Your highly attuned magic sense allows you to predict incoming spells. If you are quick enough, this can let you dodge or counter them. Can also easily tell when an Overcity entrance is nearby, though it will take time to determine exactly how to activate it. Works even out of costume. |
| **17-18** | **Regeneration** | You heal & recover mana faster than normal, way faster. If it doesn't kill you outright, you can live through almost any injury. | Severed limbs can be reattached just by holding them to your stumps. Can spend mana to enhance this power and speed up your rate of healing. Outlast your opponents in a fight. Works even out of costume, increasing stamina and recovery speed, though your healing rate is greatly reduced. |
| **19-20** | **Tentacles** | You have command of something tentacle-like (Chains, vines, cords, ropes, perhaps even actual tentacles). | They grow from your outfit or if you concentrate, from various points in the area you designate. They have simple minds of their own with a general sense of what you want them to do. Can act with very little direction from you, or you can take exacting control for one chain, rope, or tentacle. You don't get any tactile feedback from them, but you always know where your tentacles are in relation to your body. |
